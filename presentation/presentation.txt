Polarity Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis algorithms fall into one of three buckets
1. Rule-based
2. Automatic
3. Hybrid

For presentation
1. box plot with the target class distribution
2. compare text before-after cleaning

pre-processing
1. trim text
1. lower case
2. Remove stop words, no need for this operations since in sentiment analysis we will loose information
   e.g.
   An example could be the following sentence: “I told you that she was not happy”.
   Let’s remove the stop words with the Aruana library:
   The result would be [‘told’, ‘happy’].

Text Vectorization - Convert natural language into numerical form
1. Bag of words
The problem with this method is that it doesn’t capture the meaning of the text, or the context in which words appear, even when using n-grams.
2. word2vec
3. Skip-Thought Vectors
